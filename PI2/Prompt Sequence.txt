create a new branch in drwilliamroney/releasemanagement called PI2 and start a draft PR.  Checkout this branch into the workspace

build a TODO.md which lists the sequence of steps necessary to implement this PI.  For each step, include and dependencies

add a link to the TODO in the README

commit these changes to PI2, adding the TODO Pass1 as well
[TODO Pass1 is what it came up with.  The timeline is it's estimate for human time, I think?]

Do step 1 and update each task.  [committed and pushed output as TODO Pass2]

Review step 2 and identify any questions that need to be answered.  Expand steps as necessary.  [committed and pushed output as TODO Pass3, it added DECISIONS_NEEDED, saved as Pass3]
